Hello Developers,

Building servers is the backbone of any application irrespective of its scale. At the heart of any web application is an HTTP Server - a crucial component responsible for consuming requests and generate desired responses over the internet.

Golang is a widely used server programming language and we can build fast, reliable and flexible HTTP Servers to help our web applications at scale. With this idea in mind, we have build **turbo**, a light weight  router that can help you get started with minimal efforts.

Turbo - [Readme Link](https://github.com/nandlabs/golly/blob/main/turbo/README.md)

With the scope of this blog, we would be discussing on how to build a basic server using **turbo** and how to can provide configurations to the server.

## Setup your project

### 1. Check your go environment
Ensure you have go installed
```shell
go version
```

### 2. Create a new project
```shell
mkdir testProject
cd testProject
```

### 3. Initialise Go Module
You can keep the name of the module same as your project or you can select a custom. It will create a `go.mod` file based on the module defined in the command
```shell
go mod init myModule
```

### 4. Install golly package
you would be required to install the golly package in order to use the turbo library
```shell
go get oss.nandlabs.io/golly
```

Your `go.mod` file would like below
```shell filename="go.mod"
module myModule

go 1.22.4

require oss.nandlabs.io/golly v1.0.0
```

## Start building a simple server using turbo

### 1. Create a Main Go file
```shell
touch main.go
```

### 2. Write your simple server following the instructions
```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"time"

	"oss.nandlabs.io/golly/turbo"
)

func main() {
	// register the router by creating the turbo object
	router := turbo.NewRouter()

	// add a GET endpoint to your server by providing the "endpoint" and handler function
	router.Get("/api/v1/healthz", healthCheck)

	// create the http.Server object and register the router as Handler
	// provide the necessary configurations such as PORT, ReadTimeout, WriteTimeout...
	srv := &http.Server{
		Handler:      router,
		Addr:         ":8080",
		ReadTimeout:  20 * time.Second,
		WriteTimeout: 20 * time.Second,
	}

	// to start the server, invoke the ListenAndServe method
	if err := srv.ListenAndServe(); err != nil {
		log.Fatalln(err)
	}
}

func healthCheck(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	w.Write([]byte("server is up and running"))
	w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
}
```

A few things to note,
1. Creating the router object, `turbo.NewRouter()` creates a new object and returns the object of the router
2. You use that router object and register your desired routes in your server. Multiple methods have been exposed and detailed explanation can be found in the **turbo** documentation.

### 3. Running your server
```shell
go run main.go
```
Running the server will generate the logs like below
```shell
[timestamp] INFO Initiating Turbo
[timestamp] INFO Registering New Route: /api/v1/healthz
```
You can see the list of registered routes on your server

### 4. Invoking your API
```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/healthz
```
generates the following response
> server is up and running

### Project Details
[Project Link](https://github.com/nandlabs/golly)

This was a basic server registration and a simple GET endpoint implementation using **turbo**.
There are a lot of customisations and features which we will discuss in the coming parts of **turbo** in the series.
