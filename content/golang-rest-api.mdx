### Why Choose Go (Golang) for Server-Side Development?

Choosing Go (Golang) for server-side development is often driven by its key strengths:

- **Performance:** Go's concurrency model, based on goroutines and channels, allows for efficient handling of multiple tasks simultaneously, making it ideal for high-performance server applications.

- **Simplicity:** The language is designed to be simple and easy to read, with minimalistic syntax. This makes it easier to maintain, even for large projects. 

- **Fast Compilation and Execution:** Go compiles directly to machine code, resulting in fast execution times compared to interpreted languages like Python or Node.js. 

- **Scalability:** Go's built-in concurrency and lightweight nature make it a good choice for building scalable services that can handle a large number of requests. 

- **Strong Standard Library:** Go comes with a powerful standard library, particularly for building networked services, handling HTTP, and managing concurrency, reducing the need for external dependencies.

These factors make Go a great fit for modern server-side applications, especially when performance and scalability are important.

### How to build a REST API server in Golang?

There are a lot of frameworks present to build your REST API Servers in Golang like Gin, Gorrilla-Mux and many other.

We would be using a new framework `golly` which gives a comprehensive set of tools to build your `Golang applications`.

**Let's deep dive into the implementation**

Desired APIs we want to build

```bash
GET /api/v1/users
POST /api/v1/users
PUT /api/v1/users/:id
DELETE /api/v1/users/:id
```

Once we have defined our needed APIs, we start by initiating out go project. Use the following commands:-

```bash
mkdir my-go-server
cd my-go-server
go mod init rest_server

go get oss.nandlabs.io/golly
```

Once you perform the above action you should be able to see a folder structure like below

Now we can start creating our desired server structure

Create a `main.go` file which contains the `main()` i.e. the entry point of your golang application

```go
package main

import "rest_server/server"

func main() {
        // create the instance of your server
	srv := server.NewServer()
        // start your server
	srv.Start()
}
```

Create a `/server/server.go` file which contains your server configuration

```go
package server

import (
	"rest_server/handlers"
	"rest_server/store"

	"oss.nandlabs.io/golly/lifecycle"
	"oss.nandlabs.io/golly/rest/server"
)

type Server struct {
	store *store.Store
}

func NewServer() *Server {
	return &Server{
		store: store.NewStore(),
	}
}

func (s *Server) Start() {
	// register the router by creating the server object
	restServer, err := server.Default()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Add path prefix if you want
	restServer.Opts().PathPrefix = "/api/v1"

	// register routes
	restServer.Get("/users", handlers.GetUsers)
	restServer.Post("/users", handlers.AddUser)
	restServer.Put("/users/:id", handlers.UpdateUser)
	restServer.Delete("/users/:id", handlers.DeleteUser)

	// create the http.Server object and register the router as Handler
	// provide the necessary configurations such as PORT, ReadTimeout, WriteTimeout...
	manager := lifecycle.NewSimpleComponentManager()

	// Register the server
	manager.Register(restServer)

	// start the server
	manager.StartAndWait()
}

```

The application structure you would want to achieve is like below

![Desired Application Structure](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/10nunwrzwznrmlyr2956.png)

Create a in-memory store under `/store/store.go` in order to test your CRUD operations.

```go
package store

import "rest_server/models"

type Store struct {
	data map[string]models.Item
}

var initStore *Store

func NewStore() *Store {
	initStore = &Store{data: make(map[string]models.Item)}
	return initStore
}

func GetStore() *Store {
	return initStore
}

func (s *Store) GetAll() []models.Item {
	items := []models.Item{}
	for _, item := range s.data {
		items = append(items, item)
	}
	return items
}

func (s *Store) GetById(id string) (item models.Item, exists bool) {
	item, exists = s.data[id]
	return
}

func (s *Store) Put(id string, item models.Item) {
	s.data[id] = item
}

func (s *Store) Delete(id string) {
	delete(s.data, id)
}
```

This would refer to the models present under `/models/item.go`
```go
package models

type Item struct {
	ID    string `json:"id"`
	Value string `json:"value"`
}
```

The handlers would contain the handler for each endpoint defined under `/server/server.go`.

One such implementation of a `/handlers/AddUser.go` is below
```go
package handlers

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"net/http"

	"rest_server/models"
	"rest_server/response"
	"rest_server/store"

	"oss.nandlabs.io/golly/rest/server"
	"oss.nandlabs.io/golly/uuid"
)

func AddUser(ctx server.Context) {
	// create the model type variable
	var item models.Item
	// decode the request body to the item reference
	if err := json.NewDecoder(ctx.GetRequest().Body).Decode(&item); err != nil {
		// in case of error write the error to the response and return
		response.Error(ctx.HttpResWriter(), http.StatusBadRequest, "invalid request payload")
		return
	}

	// get the store object 
	initStore := store.GetStore()

	uuid, err := uuid.V1()
	if err == nil {
		// assign the uuid generated to the item
		item.ID = uuid.String()
		// add the input body item to the store
		initStore.Put(item.ID, item)
		// generate a success response
		response.JSON(ctx.HttpResWriter(), http.StatusCreated, item)
	} else {
		// generate the error response
		response.Error(ctx.HttpResWriter(), http.StatusBadRequest, "error generating uuid")
		return
	}
}
```

Similarly, you can create other handlers with the desired logic.

Full example can be found on this [github repository](https://github.com/nandlabs/golly-samples/tree/main/rest-server/server-routing)

Once you have created your server, you can start your server using below command
```bash
cd /my-go-server

go run main.go
```

Output should be like below

![Server Startup Logs](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dfyso70d6q7jlthw89lo.png)
You can see the registered endpoints and where the server is started.

Once the Server is started, you can use Postman or Curl command to invoke your APIs.

You can see how quickly we were able to spin-up a REST server using `golly` framework in golang.

**Benefits of using `golly` as my go-to framework to build go application**

- All the libraries used be it lifecycle management, UUID generation, logging, rest-server management and many more is provided out of the box by `golly`.
- Large number of inbuilt libraries present, where I don't have to import multiple third party libraries which keeps my go.mod clean and managable.
- Simple and quick implementation of the modules, easy learning curve.
- Open source library
